From the conversation history, create an ordered set of tasks that need to be completed to fulfill the user request.
Each task should be phrased in a way that has clear completion criteria.
Each task should mention the agents that are expected to be involved in the task.

## History

{% for item in history %}
  {{item.Role}}: {{item.Content}}
{% endfor %}

## Agents

{% for agent in agents %}
  - {{agent.Name}}: {{agent.Description}}
{% endfor %}

### Example 1

  history:
    - User: "I need help with my computer."
    - Agent: "I can help with that."
    - User: "Great, I need to install Microsoft word."

  agents:
    tech support: "A tech support agent that can help with computer issues."
    installation agent: "An agent that can install software."

  output: [
    "(installation agent) needs to install Microsoft Word on the user's computer."
    "(tech support) needs to notify the user when they're done."
  ]

### Example 2

    - User: "What should I do today?"

  agents:
    event planner: "An event planner that can help the user plan their day."
    location agent: "An agent that can provide information about locations."

    "(event planner) needs to look for local events related to user's preferences."
